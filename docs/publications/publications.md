## **Before Writing the Article**
As a scientist (Myrann speaking), our mission is to share knowledge with a specific scientific community. For me, it’s the quantum gases community. During your project, identify the questions this community is asking, why they are significant, and what might be worth exploring. Even if others have noticed similar phenomena, if you can investigate further and provide solid proof, it’s essential to explain and share it rigorously. Engage with theorists—after conducting some preliminary experiments to demonstrate your capabilities—they can help refine your understanding of the community's expectations and maybe create an amazing collaboration.

## **When Starting to Write the Article**
- Ensure you have results that are interesting to the community, including draft figures with relevant observables.
- **Choose a journal** (PRL, PRX, Nature, etc.). This decision will influence the article's format (short or long) and target audience. The readership of Nature is not the same as PRL, and the journal’s guidelines will direct how you format figures and structure the text.
- **Set up an Overleaf project** using the group account, share it with contributors, then log out to keep the account secure. Credentials are available in the ESSENTIAL channel on Mattermost (pinned message).
- Discussion about **author contributions and the author list** will happen at the end—leave this to the team leader, who has the necessary perspective to make the final decision.

---

## **How to Write the Article**
1. **Start with a clear story**: Determine the narrative and how to present it, which is best achieved by focusing on the figures. With numerous results and draft plots, condense them into 3–4 key figures based on your journal’s requirements. Once the structure of Figure 1, 2, etc., is clear, you can begin writing.
2. **Write systematically**: 
   - Start with figure captions.
   - Draft technical sections (as you know these best).
   - Add the details and transitions afterward.
   - Leave the abstract and conclusion for the end.
   - Work on the introduction with the team leader, as it involves the most citations.
3. **Manage references**: Use a `.bib` file for citations, preferably by creating a Zotero folder. Add articles to this folder, then export it as a `.bib` file.
4. **Write supplementary materials** in a separate `.tex` file. Include highly technical details that are not crucial to the main article’s narrative.

## **Submitting to arXiv (which can be tricky)**
1. Create an account (team leaders can help with the referral process if needed).
2. Know your community (e.g., for me: condensed matter quantum gases, with a secondary category in quantum physics later).
3. Start the submission process:
   - For adding files, follow this guide to export your Overleaf project efficiently: [Export_project](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/How_do_I_download_the_automatically_generated_files_(e.g._.bbl%2C_.aux%2C_.ind%2C_.gls)_for_my_project%3F_My_publisher_asked_me_to_include_them_in_my_submission). This ensures you include the required `.bbl` file instead of a `.bib` file.
   - Verify the generated PDF matches your vision.
4. **Metadata**: Ensure accuracy as modifications can delay publication and create a new submission link.
5. **Optimize submission timing**: To maximize visibility, aim to be the first in the next mailing list:
   - Pause your submission and wait for the mailing list's cutoff time, which you can track here: [Arxiv_time](https://arxiv.org/localtime).
   - Submit immediately after the cutoff to secure a top position on the list.
6. Two days later, your article will appear on arXiv. You’ll receive a code by email—share it with co-authors so they can claim authorship.

## **Post-Submission**
- Create a Google Scholar profile and an ORCID account. This will enhance your visibility as a scientist and help you stay updated with articles related to your work.

### **Submitting to a Journal (e.g., PRA)**

Submitting an article to a journal like **Physical Review A (PRA)** is similar to submitting to arXiv, but with additional considerations specific to the journal's guidelines and expectations. Here’s how to navigate the process effectively:

---

### **Key Differences and Preparations**
1. **Understand the Journal’s Focus**: 
   - **PRA** is typically more technical and focuses on well-established methodologies, rigorous proofs, and detailed analyses. Novelty is less critical compared to journals like PRL, but the work must be thorough and presented systematically.
   - Journals like **PRL** emphasize groundbreaking results, requiring concise writing and a clear demonstration of the work’s novelty and broad impact.

2. **Structured Presentation**:
   - PRA requires **distinct sections** (e.g., I. Introduction, II. Methodology, III. Results, IV. Discussion, V. Conclusion). Plan your article accordingly.
   - Ensure that the logical flow between sections is seamless, guiding the reader through your work step-by-step.

3. **Figures and Tables**:
   - Pay close attention to **figure size**, font sizes (usually **10 pt or larger** for text within figures), and **consistent formatting** as per PRA guidelines.
   - Ensure figures are clear in grayscale, as printed versions may not include color.
   - PRA allows detailed supplementary materials for technical results, but the main text should remain concise and focused.

4. **Length and Formatting**:
   - PRA has strict **page limits** depending on the type of submission (e.g., regular articles vs. Rapid Communications).
   - Adhere to formatting guidelines provided in their LaTeX templates, available on the APS (American Physical Society) website.

---

### **Steps for Submission**
1. **Prepare the Manuscript**:
   - Follow the journal’s LaTeX template for formatting.
   - Ensure figures are embedded in the text or provided separately as high-resolution files.
   - Review **all elements**—abstract, introduction, body, references, and supplementary materials—for compliance with PRA’s expectations.

2. **Check Novelty and Relevance**:
   - Although PRA is less focused on novelty than PRL, the work must still be relevant and valuable to the community.
   - Highlight how your results contribute to advancing the field.

3. **Reference and Citation Management**:
   - PRA demands accurate and complete citations in a `.bib` file or included manually if required.
   - Cross-check every reference for completeness and correct formatting as per the APS citation style.

4. **Online Submission System**:
   - PRA submissions are handled through the **APS Editorial System**. Create an account or log in to begin.
   - Upload your manuscript, supplementary materials (if any), and associated files (figures, `.bbl` for references, etc.).
   - Review the **cover letter**: it should briefly summarize the study, state why it’s a good fit for PRA, and highlight its significance.

5. **Address Journal-Specific Requirements**:
   - PRA may require specific metadata, such as ORCID IDs for authors or institutional affiliations.
   - Be mindful of their ethical guidelines, including author contributions and conflicts of interest.

6. **Technical Checks**:
   - Ensure the manuscript passes all technical checks (e.g., PDF readability, figure quality, and compliance with journal rules).
   - Verify that the **abstract and title** are optimized for search engines and visibility.

---

### **Review Process**
- After submission, PRA articles undergo a **peer review** process. Reviewers focus on the clarity of presentation, the rigor of the methodology, and the contribution to the field.
- Be prepared for **revision requests**:
   - Review comments carefully and respond to each point in a detailed **response letter**.
   - Update the manuscript accordingly, and highlight changes in the revised version.

---

### **Tips for Success**
- PRA submissions are competitive, so **clarity, structure, and thoroughness** are essential.
- Engage your team during the revision process, ensuring all co-authors agree with the final version before resubmission.
- Always proofread carefully to avoid delays due to minor formatting or language issues.

By adhering to PRA’s guidelines and tailoring your submission to meet their expectations, you can enhance the chances of a smooth review process and eventual publication.
