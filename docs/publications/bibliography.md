## How to access articles

If like myself you're not too happy that your university have to pay for
journals with public money, to access research funded by public money, I
suggest to bypass the middlemens while we lack a better system.

[Anna's archive](https://annas-archive.org/) is a digital library, they
currently reference 16% of all book ever issued with an ISBN
[[1]](https://annas-archive.org/blog/all-isbns.html). The source code
for the website is [openly available](https://software.annas-archive.li/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive).

Anna's archive is scraping other (illegal depending on where you live) 
websites to retrieve books and articles such as Sci-Hub, SciDB, libgen,
z-library and others. You can either download books from partners servers
(Fast downloads is for paid members only), or from the third party website
it's been collected from.

When looking for a book, don't forget you can search by author's name,
and sort by date of publication in case you have trouble finding it.

When looking for a paper, provide the [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier)
of the paper, usually found on the journal's webpage where the paper has been published.
This is more reliable than providing the paper's title.


## How to store bibliography

After a while you'll find that you have papers scattered all over your
different computers, and that it's hard to keep track of what is where.
Especially when you want to share them with other people. The lab decided
to use [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to keep a centralised database of
articles members of the group found useful. You can sign up for free, and
ask Maxime Jacquet to add you to the group's library.

## How to monitor literature

This is a draft, this aspect has not been thoroughly investigated by
the group yet. 

To find interesting article, it might not be practical to read through
50 years of published papers in the field.
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), if you're willing to sell
your soul to capitalism and create an account, will provide you with daily
relevant suggestions based on the authors you like.
[Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbitapp.com/home) gives you suggestions
based on a set of papers. It is capable (in theory) to give you the founding
papers, similar, newer and older papers than the set you provided.
It does force you to sign up with an account even if you don't need the
functionality.
