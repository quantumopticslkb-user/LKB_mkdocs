## Obtain a KABA key

You need to go to the administrative office and check with Laetitia Morel or David Noël. You will need to specify a "profile" of the key i.e which doors it will open. For this it is easiest to give the same profile as another older PhD student / Post doc. 

**Access Control Service Details**:  
**Access Rights Management** 
When your key is ready you will have to go with an ID to the bottom of Tour 65/55 – Jussieu Level   ("Gestion de droits d'accès").

Don't forget to bring a valid ID.


Sometimes, the key might be a little buggy, in this case you might want to revive it by going to the magic KABA pillar in tower 23 first floor : there is a port on one of the pillars that resets your KABA key.
