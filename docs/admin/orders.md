!!! info
    This tutorial aims at explaining how to handle administrative tasks upon your arrival. All these informations are available with more details in the [LKB Intranet](https://intranet.lkb.upmc.fr/).


##  Orders

To do an order there are **seven** parts:<br>
(1) get a quote<br>
(2) ask for validation to your PI<br>
(3) add the order to the Mattermost Board<br>
(4) fill out the order form<br>
(5) send the quote and order form to the admin at **gestion@lkb.upmc.fr**<br>
(6) once the product is delivered, bring the signed delivery sheet to the admin <br>
(7) close the order on Mattermost Board

Details about each step are listed below.

!!! Exception
    For **Amazon** orders, you just need to send an email to the administration (use the adress **gestion@lkb.upmc.fr** for it to be acknolegded faster) containing a list with:<br>
    - the URL of the item<br>
    - the number of items<br>
    - the NACRE code (see below)<br>

!!! Exception
    Previously, Loic from Electronic workshop was taking care of the orders, and we used this procedure:<br>
    <br>
    For **RS Electronics** orders, you need to create an account on the **FRENCH** RS electronics website (US wont work) and fill your cart. Then you need to send an email to **Loic Garcia** at **loic.garcia@lkb.upmc.fr** to inform him about your order, this email should contain: <br>
    - your name, the name of the team (15B) and the PI <br>
    - the credit you want to use <br>
    Finally use the "transfer cart via email" button on RS Electronics website. Loic will take it from here.<br>
    <br>
    Now, he often refuses to pass orders for us, in this case we use David's account with this procedure:<br>
    <br>
    First know which credit you want to use: <br>
    -> if **Sorbonne** credit: login noelSU, pwd: see Mattermost<br>
    -> if **CNRS** credit: login noelCNRS, pwd: see Mattermost<br>
    - Fill up your cart and pass the order, when asked to choose an approbator, pick either **David or Céline**.<br>
    - Very important: when you do the order, **WRITE IN THE COMMENT SECTION YOUR NAME AND TEAM (15B) and the CREDIT NAME** for the admin to know who passed the order.<br>
    - Finalize the order and make sure that an email is sent to the right person (David or Céline).<br>

!!! Exception
    In rare occasions, planets align and you may be awarded the right to use the Lab Credit Card. It is stored in Quentin's and Alberto's office and the secret code is passed on from generations to generations. If you use this card then you **always need to get a bill** from the supplier. A card ticket is not enough! (unless it is stamped by the company)

### Asking a quote

When you are shopping for a brand new item for your lab, you need to first check the sellers with whom we have a discount. Those include : **Thorlabs**, **Edmund Optics**, **RS Electronics** (and more but you need to check with the administrative office). For these companies, we usually have a client number to fill out in order to see the discounted prices at checkout.\
Once you finish your basket, you need to **ask for a quote** and not try to finish the order like you would do for a personnal buy. There is usually a button somewhere at the end of the procedure, or you can directly contact the sales with an email. This is important because if you launch an order without first getting a quote, you may receive stuff that you will not be able to pay afterwards !

!!! info
    For **Thorlabs** orders, it depends on the credit you use: <br>
    <br>
    (1) if **SU credit**: <br>
    - Use customer ID 408572 to get a **10% discount!** (except specific items like microscope objectives). <br>
    - Be sure to use the following billing adress: <br>
    **Sorbonne Université - Comptabilite Fournisseur - BC 500 4 place Jussieu, 75005 Paris, France** <br>
    - I you don't have it already, send an email to TL reminding them that you have 10% discount for Quentin Glorieux's group to get the final quotation. <br>
    - and the shipping adress should be: <br>
    **Laboratoire Kastler Brossel-CNRS, Tour 23 - 2ème étage Couloir Ouest-Bureau 203, 4 Place Jussieu - Case 74, 75252 PARIS Cedex 05**<br>
    <br>
    (2) if **CNRS credit** : <br>
    - Use customer ID 403832 : **9% discount** (but not on US stuff or microscope objectives).<br>
    - You need to check that the facturation adress is: <br>
    **CNRS 1285, CNRS -SCTD, 2 Rue Jean Zay, TSA° 31001, 54519 VANDOEUVRE LES NANCY, France**<br>
    (normally thorlabs should automatically add this to the quote with the account number)<br>
    - and the shipping adress should be: <br>
    **Laboratoire Kastler Brossel-CNRS, Tour 23 - 2ème étage Couloir Ouest-Bureau 203, 4 Place Jussieu - Case 74, 75252 PARIS Cedex 05**<br>

### Register in Mattermost
Register your order in the group's [Mattermost Board](https://mattermost.lkb.upmc.fr/boards/team/pbzjndnyx7nefgruk14er9fcqy/b7rotd56x7frrmnua364i9en84a/vju4844q68bbgtbh5xcenksaezy). Please attach all the possible information in the post and **don't forget the quote!**

### The order form or "Bon de commande"

If you wish to order something, you will have to first get a quote from the seller, and then fill out an order form ("bon de commande"). The template for such a file can be found on the [intranet](https://intranet.lkb.upmc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bon_commande_v6_8.pdf) of the lab, or in the administrative office in 13-23 second floor, or here:

![bon_commande](/assets/img/StartingPackage/general/bon_commande.png){ width=600 }

In order to fill out this form, you will need to fill the following fields : <br>
- **DEMANDEUR** : This is you, the person who wants to order. You will need to fill in your name and telephone number. <br>
- **N°PIECE** : The room in which the stuff you order will be stored. <br>
- **FOURNISSEUR** : The seller. You need to put an address and a phone number. Try to fill this with the french department of the company (if applicable). <br>
- **NOM CRÉDIT** : This is the tricky part. You need to figure out where the money that pays the order comes from. You usually need to ask a permanent staff member for this question. You also need to tick the box corresponding to the organism that hosts the money : either CNRS (the lab), ENS (École Normale Supérieure) or UPMC (Sorbonne Université). Even in the case where your order will be paid by a special grant (like an ANR grant for instance), the money will go to either the lab or the hosting university (ENS or SU). If it is an order for an item above 15k€/20k€, you will need to do an invitation to tender (appel d'offre) and fill out the relevant numbers for this (Numéro marché / PUMA etc ...). <br>
- **NOM PERMANENT** : The permanent staff member that allows the purchase. <br>

Then comes the tricky part ... You need to fill out every item in the file, translating all items name to french, and using a [nomenclature](https://intranet.lkb.upmc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/referentiel_nacres-2014.zip) that is highly non-trivial (NACRES nomenclature). Most of the optics stuff has code OA01, but you need to check for everything in this file. To make filling out this part easier, you can use [this](https://github.com/laboGigan/thorlabsBC) excellent Python repo written by the Gigan team.

!!! Exception
    Sometimes if all articles are below 3k euros and share the same NACRE code, you can fill the "Bon de Commande" with only one line! But ask the admins before to be sure.


### After receiving the item

After you received all of your order, **you need to quickly bring the shipping label to the administrative office** on the second floor in order to pay the seller ! If you do not do this, the lab can be **blacklisted** from certain suppliers that are tired of not getting paid ! This has already happened more than once and it is a penalty for the whole lab !

If it's a on site service without shipping label, fill the form [this form](/assets/pdfs/CNRS-Attestation-de-livraison.pdf), and give it to secretary for them to finally pay the service.
