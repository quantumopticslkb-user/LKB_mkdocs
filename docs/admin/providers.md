## CNRS material market

For all type of lab supplies, a market is opened on the intranet of CNRS. You can access it via this link : 

-> [Bourse aux matériels CNRS](https://intranet.cnrs.fr/Cnrs_pratique/achats/boursemateriel/Pages/default.aspx)

You can find anything from microscopes to 3D printers for all prices (including gifts !)

## UGAP

Ugap is a public market that sells all kind of office supplies to public services. This includes office chairs, electronics, computers... 

You can access it [here](https://www.ugap.fr/)

## Chemistry supplies

There is a chemistry shop on Campus called SIARE ([see website](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/faculte/ufr-instituts-observatoires-ecoles/ufr-de-chimie/service-la-recherche-et-lenseignement-0)). It is run by the chemistry department.

!!! Info 
    A catalog is available on the intranet of Sorbonne! (and [here](/assets/pdfs/SIARE Catalogue 2025.pdf))

    Before going to SIARE you need to go to the admin office to ask for the Lab Order Book. I contains all the infos about the lab and will be the only place where you write your order details for future facturation.

It's divided in two spots:

- **The shop:** opened from 9h -12h and 14h - 17h (Phone : 01 44 27 30 92). It's located in tower 42-43, 101 bis. For any question or to order online, contact them by email at **magasin.siare@upmc.fr** with the Lab client code.

- **The solvant hold:** opened Monday, Wednesday et Friday between 9h30 and 11h30 (Phone: 01 44 27 32 00). It's the prefered way to get chemicals
for the lab (lense cleaning and so on).


## Hardware

There is a legend that say that we have a hardware shop in Jussieu tower 25 Jussieu level, we never found it... maybe if you
investigate you'll find out more ?

## Electronics supply

The Lab has it's own electronic workshop in corridor 12-13, 3rd floor. They have
common electronics components, (de)soldering stations. For more specialized/expensive
stuff, we often use [RS-electronics](https://fr.rs-online.com/web/) (see [Orders](/admin/orders/))

## Optics components

[Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/) is the prefered way to get small quantities of optics,
and want it fast. For bigger orders, you should ask for quotes at other companies, they are much
cheaper than Thorlabs. (see [Orders](/admin/orders/))
