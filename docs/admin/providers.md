## Chemistry shop

There is a chemistry shop on Campus run by the chemistry department. 
It is open from 9h -12h and 14h - 17h (Phone : 01 44 27 30 92).
It's located in tower 42-43, 101 bis. It's the prefered way to get chemicals
for the lab (lense cleaning and so on).

## Hardware

There is a legend that say that we have a hardware shop in Jussieu, maybe if you
investigate you'll find out more ?

## Electronics supply

The Lab has it's own electronic workshop in corridor 12-13, 3rd floor. They have
common electronics components, (de)soldering stations. For more specialized/expensive
stuff, we often use [RS-electronics](https://fr.rs-online.com/web/)

## Optics components

[Thorlabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/) is the prefered way to get small quantities of optics,
and want it fast. For bigger orders, you should ask for quotes at other companies, they are much
cheaper than Thorlabs.
