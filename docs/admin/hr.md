## Hire an intern 

To prepare grant agreement under the best conditions, here are some reminders regarding the guidelines to follow for the proper handling of internship agreements:
1.	Contact David at least 3 weeks before the start of the internship.
2.	Before sending the agreement, or during the submission by your intern (if they are a student at SU and submit via the SU platform), it is important to agree with your intern on certain elements. These should be completed in the agreement or communicated to David via email if the submission is through the SU platform:
- Start date of the internship
- End date of the internship
- Any vacation days
- Internship topic
- Internship objectives (tasks assigned, skills to acquire, etc.)
- Supervision arrangements
3.	If the intern is paid, please specify to David which account should be used for the payment.
4.	For part-time internships (not present every day):
A schedule must be prepared (e.g., in .xls format) and attached to the internship agreement.
