# VS Code

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): the world's most used code editor : not for nothing. In this editor you will be able to run any language you want but also write your papers in Latex or your lab book in Markdown. And you can add extensions to help you. Here a list of mandatory extensions :

- autoDocstring for Python: we strongly encourage you to activate the autoformatting on save. This means that VS Code will automatically make your code prettier when you save your file (access settings  by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> and then search "Format on save"). You can then choose a format provider if you're looking for specific rules.
- Jupyter and notebook: separate your code in cells and run them separately
- Pylance
- Julia
- LaTex Workshop
- Markdown All in One
- markdownlint
- Github [copilote](https://github.com/features/copilot): help of an artificial intelligence. Copilote can automatically fill in the rest of your code, adapting to what you already coded. If your github account is eligible for Copilote, you can take advantage of it. As a student, you're almost forced to have it, since it's free! [student request](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-education-for-students/apply-to-github-education-as-a-student).


Most of these extensions do not need any settings, but if you wish to, you can access those in the "Extensions" tab on the left of VS Code.\
