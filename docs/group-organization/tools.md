# Organization tools
Here are all the communication and sharing tools used by the team.

## Mattermost
Used for communication inside the team and with other lkb members.

- Get an LKB account (ask the IT people)
- Get the [desktop app](https://mattermost.com/apps/)
- Join the team server (get the invite link from a team member) and join the channels:

    - ESSENTIALS
    - Bibliography
    - Group meetings
    - Daily chatting
    - Lunch
    - Rubidium or Polaritons or Nano
    - Off-topics

- Join the lkb-all server (get the invite link from a team member)

- Join the "Orders" and "Wishlist" boards (at the top left of Mattermost app), to keep track of the orders. 

!!! info
    We have a backup server in case the main one is down: `https://framateam.org/eq15b-secours`
    
## Group meetings

Every two weeks, on Monday morning, we have either a general group meeting where one person presents his/her work, or a journal club, where one person presents a paper. Ideally, for the journal club, the presenter opens a vote between three papers about one week in advance so that the rest of the group picks their favorite.

Then each sub-team (Rb, polaritons, nano) have a separate meeting approximately once a week.

The calendar of the group meeting/journal club presentations (who presents when) is in the google group calendar...

## Google groups and calendars

This is the procedure to gain access to all the Google calendars with the Google group : 

- go to [groups.google.com/g/eq15b](https://groups.google.com/g/eq15b) once you have received the invite
- go to "Conversations"
- you will find all the messages containing the invite links to all of the calendars

!!! warning
    Please, try to refrain using the quantumopticslkb@gmail.com account! This is a "quick and dirty" solution that has caused a lot of issues in the past since people were using it without realizing, messing up permissions / important organization stuff.

- if you are part of the Rb team, also add: [https://groups.google.com/g/eq15b-rubidium](https://groups.google.com/g/eq15b-rubidium)

## Group github
You have to share your codes [here](https://github.com/Quantum-Optics-LKB). 

!!! warning
    Whenever you create a new repository, add it to the index (in the README.md that is displayed on the welcome page), in the relevant category, with a few words of description.


## RbLab_Organisation repository

(Private) github [repository](https://github.com/Quantum-Optics-LKB/RbLab_Organisation) to keep tracks of the Rb team meetings, ideas, roadmaps...

## Labbooks

We chose to have the labbooks on markdown (md) files and gather them in a github repository. For the Rb team, the repo is [here](https://github.com/Quantum-Optics-LKB/RbLabBook).\
For the Rb team, they are (more or less) organized as follow : Name/Experiment/year/month .

A convenient markdown editor, synchronized with github,  is [NotesHub](https://about.noteshub.app/). Its main advantage is to be able to drag and frop images and files. You can also easily create kanban boards (files .kanban.md), which is convenient for task lists for instance.\
Once you imported a github repository on NotesHub, it is automatically regularly synchronized. 

NotesHub is available on Windows and Mac, but not on linux. But you can also simply use VSCode to edit the md files - some people prefer it as you have better control over the version (commit, pull...). You can actually also [drag and drop images in md files VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown). Also, Quentin Glorieux created a nice kanban-noteshub-viewer VSCode extension so that you can also open the noteshub kanban files (files with extension .kanban.md) on VSCode and drag and drop the blocs.
