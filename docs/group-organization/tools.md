# Organization tools
Here are all the communication and sharing tools used by the team.

## Mattermost
Used for communication inside the team and with other lkb members.

- Get an account (ask the IT people)
- Get the [desktop app](https://mattermost.com/apps/)
- Join the team server (get the invite link from a team member) and join the channels:

    - ESSENTIALS
    - Bibliography
    - Group meetings
    - Daily chatting
    - Lunch
    - Rubidium or Polaritons or Nano
    - Off-topics

- Join the lkb-all server (get the invite link from a team member)

- Join the "Orders" board, to keep track of the orders. 


## Google groups and calendars

This is the procedure to gain access to all the Google calendars with the Google group : 

- go to [groups.google.com/g/eq15b](groups.google.com/g/eq15b) once you have received the invite
- go to "Conversations"
- you will find all the messages containing the invite links to all of the calendars

Please, try to refrain using the quantumopticslkb@gmail.com account !
This is a "quick and dirty" solution that has caused a lot of issues in the past since people were using it without realizing, messing up permissions / important organization stuff.

- if you are part of the Rb team, also add: [eq15b-rubidium@googlegroups.com](eq15b-rubidium@googlegroups.com)
